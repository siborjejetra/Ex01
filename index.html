	<h1> Jetra Mae S. Sibor </h1>
	<h2> Jet </h2>
  <ol>
	<li>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 130 because binary numbers is not that confusing unlike programming subjects. </li>
    	<li> Ethics is my favorite GE so far, the professor is cool, the topics are eye-opening, my classmates are fun, what's there not to like? </li>
    	<li> To be honest, I don't even like programming but for the sake of this qustion, I think Python is the easiest.</li> 
    	<li> There's nothing special happenings during my semestral break. Most days were spent laying on my bed, just there freeing myself from stress.</li> 
    	<li> When Taal volcano erupted, I was already here at LB. I live in Calamba and I kinda want to stay away from there because there's no electricity and water supply. I just spent those days locked in our apartment.</li> 
	<li> I play basketball during my leisure time. Actually, more like sleeping. </li>  
	<li> Swimming pools in Pansol, Calamba, Laguna are visited by people, including tourists, for it's warm and relaxing water. Another is Dr. Jose Rizal's house in Calamba Proper.</li>  
	<li> When I was a kid, I dreamed of being a doctor, a surgeon to be specific, because I want to see other people's internal organs.</li>
